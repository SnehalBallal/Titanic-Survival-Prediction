Project Description: Titanic Survival Prediction
Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques. This project leverages historical data to build a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of survival based on various passenger attributes.

Objectives
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing data to improve model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data through visualization and summary statistics.

Model Building: Develop a predictive model using logistic regression.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Tech Stack
Python: The primary programming language for the project.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: To build and evaluate machine learning models.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Steps Involved
Data Loading: Import the Titanic dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.

Data Cleaning: Identify and fill missing values in the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Convert categorical variables into numerical values and create new features such as FamilySize.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data to identify patterns and relationships.

Model Building: Select relevant features, split the data into training and testing sets, and train a logistic regression model.

Model Evaluation: Make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
